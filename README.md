# Portfolio_Framework
Framework for a new portfolio. I made this in the Udacity nanodegree, this is just a framework that uses placeholder images. This website is also built to be responsive utilizing Bootstrap. I will start adding pages as soon as I make more, also when I figure out how to work github pages a little better.
