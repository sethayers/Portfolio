# Portfolio_Framework
Framework for a new portfolio. I made this in the Udacity nanodegree, this is just a framework that uses placeholder images. This website is also built to be responsive utilizing Bootstrap. If you want to see the project download the file then right-click the HTML file and run with your favorite browser.(Chrome recommended)
